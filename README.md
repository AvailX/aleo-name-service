# Aleo Name Service

Aleo Name Service (ANS) is a domain name service built on the Aleo blockchain. The project consists of three main parts: the backend API, smart contracts, and a frontend website.

## Project Structure

- `backend/` - The backend API, written in Rust, providing interfaces to query and operate on Aleo Name Service.
- `program/` - The smart contracts, written in Leo language, defining the logic executed on the Aleo blockchain.
- `website/` - The frontend website, where users can interact with Aleo Name Service.

## Detailed Information for Each Module

### [backend/](./backend)

This is the backend part of the Aleo Name Service, written in Rust. The backend API provides several interfaces allowing users to query and operate ANS. Refer to [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md) for more details.

### [program/](./program)

This is the smart contract part of the Aleo Name Service, written in Leo language. The smart contract defines the core logic of ANS on the Aleo blockchain. Refer to [program/README.md](./program/README.md) for more details.

### [website/](./website)

This is the frontend part of Aleo Name Service. Users can interact with ANS intuitively through this website. Refer to [website/README.md](./website/README.md) for more details.
